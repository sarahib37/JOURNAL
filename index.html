            <h3 class="hero-subtitle">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p class="hero-preview">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to
                spend hours and hours learning, then try to create 
                simple projects using what I learned or work new
                techniques into exsting projects. <br><br>
                While that was fun I felt like it would be helpful to share
                what I was learning and most things about my journey
                with the world.
            </p>
            <h3 class="hero-subtitle">How I got started</h3>
            <p class="hero-preview">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal
                site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After
                each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only
                reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries
                of what I learned using my own words. <br><br>
                That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized 
                that posting my learning summaries was also helping 
                others learn and stay motivated.
